# Website Load Speed Tester

A simple and beginner-friendly Python project using [Playwright](https://playwright.dev/python/) to measure how fast a website loads, open the website in a browser, and save results to a text file.

## Features

 Takes user input (website URL)  
 Automatically opens the website in a browser  
 Measures total load time  
 Categorizes the result: `Fast` or `Slow`  
 Appends result to a `report.txt` file (doesn't overwrite previous tests)  
 Built with `Playwright` and pure `Python` (no AI required)
